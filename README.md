# üìñ zkSNARKs Lecture Notes (mdBook)

Hi!  This repository contains the **source code** (`src/` folder) for an `mdBook` with lecture notes, examples, and exercises.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This repo only has the source (`.md` files). The HTML pages are not published here yet.  
If you want to **read the notes**, you‚Äôll need to build and view them locally.


## üöÄ How to Build Locally

1. Install [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/):

```bash
   cargo install mdbook
````

2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Serve the book locally:

   ```bash
   mdbook serve
   ```

   This will start a local server (usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

4. Open that link in your browser and enjoy the notes
