# 📖 zkSNARKs Lecture Notes (mdBook)

Hi! 👋 This repository contains the **source code** (`src/` folder) for an `mdBook` with lecture notes, examples, and exercises about R1CS, QAPs, and Groth16.

⚠️ **Important:** This repo only has the source (`.md` files). The HTML pages are not published here yet.  
If you want to **read the notes**, you’ll need to build and view them locally.
